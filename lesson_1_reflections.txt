How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
I only saw the differences between the files instead everything and could much faster see the error.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
When something is not working I can compare with working version
I have a "diary" of what I have been done
I can explain to others
I find errors faster

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
pros - logical
cons - I am likely to forget

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git is for code. In code more files form one logical units.

How can I use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log in dir shows all the commits
compare 2 commits git diff id_old id_new

How might using version control make me more confident to make changes that could break something?
I can always go back and have a documentation of my work

What do I want to try using Git for?
My first javascript tests for my webapp; and my webapp itself for saving on github
