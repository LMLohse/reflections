What happens when I initialize a reposity? Why would I need it?
creates an invis .git dir for version control

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Its a in-between a area of all the files that will be comitted? I have done some work instead of one big everything commit
I can refine into smaller logical commits.
