When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It's always nice to have some backup.
When I want to show and share my projects.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because there might be others who modify the project and everything might get messed up. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
clones - internet to local, or local to loca - to pull from Github
fork - Github to Github - modify someones project for no general purpose
Branch - part of commit history - different aspects and features in the project

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can diff, or watchout merging conflicts

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Email-Exchange + Compare Documents - it wouldnt be easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Security critical changes, stability critical; when master in for example is not running in development mode anymore.
When I'm not sure and have to do some testing first.
